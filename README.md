## Introduction
This GitHub repository hosts the code and documentation for our Information System Security project, which is designed to enhance and manage security measures for health information systems. The project leverages Windows Presentation Forms (WPF), Oracle Database Management, and SQL to implement advanced security features including access controls, encryption, and data auditing.

## Project Structure
- **Chapter 1:** Introduction to the need for advanced information security in healthcare.
- **Chapter 2-6:** Detailed description of system architecture and security implementation including:
  - DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
  - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
  - VPD (Virtual Private Database)
